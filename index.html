<!--
only use 2 fonts so pick usually a serif for headers sans serif for body

The tutorial used floating picture and the text around them but I want a poetic
form so for me inline would be better padding oneside picture the others
centered stanza of text

need to uncomment out .EvidenceMSMain and sort the pictures out so they are inline

          <h3>Full stack websites</h3>

          <h3>Agile Project  </h3>
          <p>
            I've made an eight player bicycle controlled pirate game for drawing crowds at events for a CIC.<br>The game uses 8 bikes as electrical inputs as the only game inputs. People attending the event can:<br>
            Set up custom games and have large style team and non team pirate battles using a 4 way split screen (it takes a pair to sail a ship) and up to twenty AI opponents. <br>
            To overcome the limitation of the input timers and thresholds are used to allow user to select game options.
