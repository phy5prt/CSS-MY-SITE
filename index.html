<!--
only use 2 fonts so pick usually a serif for headers sans serif for body

The tutorial used floating picture and the text around them but I want a poetic
form so for me inline would be better padding oneside picture the others
centered stanza of text

need to uncomment out .EvidenceMSMain and sort the pictures out so they are inline

          <h3>Make Full stack websites</h3>
          <p>I've made several websites and webapps<br> using mongoose for databases, EJS for templating, node.js and bootstrap </p>
          <p>The websites include: a REST API website showing how rest work with a table.
            <br> A to do list that allows you to make custom lists at different routes. <br>
Encryption example website where you can login and leave secrets anonymously. <br> Newsletter signup website using MailChimp Api. <br>
Blog site that I've left the ability to compose the blogs available.
           </p>

          <h3>Make Unity Games in C# with monodevelop</h3>
          <p>
          I've made desktop games, browser games and mobile games.<br>
          I've made an arcanoid browser hosted game, plants vs zombies mobile game, 3D bowling game, platformer and space invaders game. <br>
           As well as element for a roller ball game and FPS game. <br>
           Following making these games I saught out a CIC and made a promotion game for public events. I made it using an agile methodology. <br>
           I've made an eight player bicycle controlled pirate game for drawing crowds at events for a CIC.<br>The game uses 8 bikes as electrical inputs as the only game inputs. People attending the event can:<br>
           Set up custom games and have large style team and non team pirate battles using a 4 way split screen (it takes a pair to sail a ship) and up to twenty AI opponents. <br>
           To overcome the limitation of the input timers and thresholds are used to allow user to select game options.

          <h3>the next fun Im planning on doing, for the doing I'll be doing when what I'm doing is done</h3>
          <p>
            I've got an educational maths game base on the plants vs zombies game I made. <br>
            More games in different genres, matched to different exercise exhertion patterns; designed for bikes. <br>
            I've got an RPG making course I'm looking forward too. <br>
            And Im hoping to meet some people at GAMEYO and join a game jam team. <br>
