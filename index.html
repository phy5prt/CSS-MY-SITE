<!--
only use 2 fonts so pick usually a serif for headers sans serif for body

The tutorial used floating picture and the text around them but I want a poetic
form so for me inline would be better padding oneside picture the others
centered stanza of text

need to uncomment out .EvidenceMSMain and sort the pictures out so they are inline
